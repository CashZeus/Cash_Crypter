# What is CASH CRYPTER
Crypter is a hacking program or application
used to hide our viruses or RATs from antivirus software so that they are not detected and deleted. Thus, a Crypter is a program that allows users to crypt the source code of their program. Generally, antiviruses work by splitting source codes of applications and then searching for a certain string within the source code.
# What does CASH Crypter do???
Crypter simply assigns hidden values to each code within the source code. Thus, the source code becomes hidden. Hence, our sent crypted trojan and virus bypass antivirus detection and our hacking is fulfilled without any AV hindrance. Not only does this Crypter hide source code, but it will also unpack the encryption once the program is executed.
# What is FUD???
FUD is an acronym for “Fully UnDetectable.” With increased use of Crypters to bypass antiviruses, AV evolved to become more advanced and now includes Crypter definitions to detect even Crypter strings within code. So, use of Crypters to hide RATs has become more complicated as nowadays, no publicly available Crypter is FUD.

So, if you crypt RATs with publicly available Crypters, they are bound to be detected by antiviruses. This is because most FUD Crypters remain “FUD” for a maximum of two days after their public release. To obtain FUD Crypters, you have to either search for one in hacking forums or make one yourself (which is somewhat tedious – I am working on this)
